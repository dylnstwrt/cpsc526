1. How many failed attempts? X
    if failed login:
        count++
    return count
    
2. What is the most common username for failed attempts? X
    if failed login:
        if username in list:
            count++ for username
        else:
            add username to list
            count = 1
    return username with highest count

1. and 2. done in tandem
    
3. How many successful logins were there? X
    if successful login:
        count++
    return count
    
4. What is the most common username for successful attempts? X
    if successful login:
        if username in list:
            count++ for username
        else:
            add username to list
            count = 1 for username
    return username with highest count

5. Source IP with the most unsuccessful logins? X
    - Count unsuccessful, keep track of IP addresses and return highest count.
    
    if failed login:
        if IP in list:
            count++ for IP
        else:
            add IP to list
            count = 1 for IP
    return IP.
    
    can be done with 1.
    
6. Top ten passwords for all login attempts: X

        else:
            add password to list:
            count = 1 for password
    
7. How many unique source IP addresses had a successful root login on the first try?
    if username == root:
        if successful:
            if in failedFirstTry (continue)
            else (count++)
        if unsuccessful:
            add to failedFirstTry
            count++ for IP
            
8. What was the maximum number of failed root logins before the first successful root log in?
    assuming count for a unique IP
    return IP with highest count in failedFirstTry
    
9. What are the five most common commands that are executed after a login X
    if command input:
        if command in list:
            count ++ for command
        else:
            add command
            count = 1 for command

10. One behaviour is to add a new ssh key authorized for future logins. Give a line number
where this command is performed X

Line 22316, look for .ssh/authorized_keys

Parsing file:
    read line:
        parse line into json
        process json data
            count failed
                count failed for usernames
                count failed for IP
                count password
            count successful
                count successful for usernames
                count password
                if username == root:
                    check if IP attempted to login prior
                    count successful on first attempt if IP doesn't exist previous
                    else keep track of highest # of attempts before login, i.e. IP
            count cmd:
                count unique commands
